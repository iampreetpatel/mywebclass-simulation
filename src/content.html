Regular security scans, penetration tests, and vulnerability assessments are conducted to identify potential risks and to ensure that the necessary security controls are in place to protect user data.</p>
<h2>5. Incident Management</h2>
<p>In the event of a security breach or data loss incident, MyWebClass.org has an incident response plan in place to ensure the timely identification, containment, and resolution of the issue. This includes notifying affected users and relevant authorities as required by applicable data protection laws.</p>
<h2>6. Employee Training</h2>
<p>All MyWebClass.org employees receive regular training on data protection and information security best practices. This includes training on identifying and reporting potential security threats, as well as maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of user data.</p>
